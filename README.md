# iotAssignment1

I put the three go files i worked on 

if you want to test clone this three repo :

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-siggen.git

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-mavg.git

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-func.git


And replace the go files by the three of this repo. After that just run make produce in each of the three folders and <mosquitto -v -t "#"> in a fourth terminal


Now we have one log file for each component in which i tried to printout the relevant times
There is a problem with the last one that i must resolve 

##########
Work to do
##########

Now the idea is to write a script which will go through the log files and process them to know the time each component take

I will also work on the test harness and try to use it for this assignment
