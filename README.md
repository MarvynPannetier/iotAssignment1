# iotAssignment1

I put the three go files i worked on 

if you want to test clone this three repo :

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-siggen.git

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-mavg.git

https://github.com/aslakjohansen/sdu-iot-mqtt-func.git


And replace the go files by the three of this repo. After that just run make produce in each of the three folders and <mosquitto -v -t "#"> in a fourth terminal

use this link for the test harness :
